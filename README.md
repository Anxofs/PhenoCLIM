# [PhenoCLIM](https://rstudio.aws.science.psu.edu:3838/aaf11/PhenoCLIM/ "PhenoCLIM")
[**PhenoCLIM**](https://rstudio.aws.science.psu.edu:3838/aaf11/PhenoCLIM/) (https://rstudio.aws.science.psu.edu:3838/aaf11/PhenoCLIM/)is an SHINY component of [**Arabidopsis CLIMtools**](http://www.personal.psu.edu/sma3/CLIMtools.html) (http://www.personal.psu.edu/sma3/CLIMtools.html) that allows the user to uncover the relationship between interspecific phenotypic variation in Arabidopsis, and its local environment.


[**PhenoCLIM**](https://rstudio.aws.science.psu.edu:3838/aaf11/PhenoCLIM/) allows the inspection of the relationship between the chosen phenotypic variable and the local environment using the ggvis package in SHINY. The more than 100 phenotypic variables that can be selected on the map can be compared with a second environmental variable that is user-specified; the two variables are displayed with a linear correlation provided based on data for the local environments of each of the phenotyped accessions. We also provide two interactive tabulated databases describing the environmental variables as we do in [**PhenoCLIM**](https://rstudio.aws.science.psu.edu:3838/aaf11/PhenoCLIM/), and the phenotypic traits we added to the database, using the DT package in SHINY.

## [Data availability](https://github.com/CLIMtools/AraCLIM/tree/master/data)
The phenotypic data described here was downloaded from AraPheno [**PhenoCLIM**](https://arapheno.1001genomes.org/). If you use any of these phenotypic traits, please do not forget to the tab describing the phenotypes included in this tool to find the appropriate references, learn more about these phenotypes and cite the appropriate originators of the data you used.

The environmental data compiled in our study is available in the data/ folder. One of the data files contains the data, and the second one contains the description and the source of each of the environmental parameters used. For a more detailed description of these, please check the SI of our study.
